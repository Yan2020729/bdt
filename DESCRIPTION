Description: 
    This R package implements adapted bootstrap diagnostic tool (BDT), originally described in Bahamyirou A, 
    Schnitzer ME. "Understanding and diagnosing the potential for bias when using machine learning methods 
    with doubly robust causal estimators." Statistical methods in medical research. 2019 Jun;28(6):1637-50.
    This BDT is to identify the instability of marginal causal effects in the presence of near practical 
    positivity violations. Data-adaptive methods can produce a separation of the two exposure groups in terms 
    of propensity score densities which can lead to biased estimates of the treatment effect. BDT is based on
    bootstrap resampling of the subjects and simulation of the outcome data in order to show that the 
    estimation using inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW), augmented inverse probability treatment 
    weighting (AIPTW) and targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) for the propensity score may lead 
    to large bias and poor coverage.
